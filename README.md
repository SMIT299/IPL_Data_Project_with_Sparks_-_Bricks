## 📊 Key Findings & Insights  
1️⃣ **Toss Wins vs. Match Wins** – Teams winning the toss had only a **moderate correlation (0.65)** with match victories, indicating that toss decisions alone do not guarantee success.  
2️⃣ **Scoring Impact** – Teams with a **higher total score** consistently won more matches, emphasizing the importance of aggressive batting strategies.  
3️⃣ **Bowling Efficiency** – Teams restricting opponents to **below 160 runs** in the first innings won **75% of the matches**, highlighting the significance of strong bowling.  
4️⃣ **Top-Order Contribution** – A **0.72 correlation** was found between top-order batsmen’s average scores and overall team success, showcasing the need for reliable opening partnerships.
